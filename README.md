#firebase-3-typescript

A firebase v3 TypeScript definition file. I've followed the firebase v3 documentation to create this file. 
As according to the documentation, firebase uses ES6 Promises I've included a copy of es6-promise.d.ts. This is however not required if tsconfig.json is set to target es6.
